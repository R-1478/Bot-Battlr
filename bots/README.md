Bot Battlr App
Overview
Bot Battlr is a simple React application that allows users to view a collection of bots, enlist them into their personal bot army, release them, and permanently discharge them from service. The app communicates with a server to fetch and manipulate bot data.

Features

Your Bot Army: Enlist bots into your personal army, release them from service, and permanently discharge them.

Enlistment Rules: A bot can only be enlisted once, and once enlisted, it is removed from the available bot collection.

Discharge: Permanently delete a bot from the server and your personal army.
